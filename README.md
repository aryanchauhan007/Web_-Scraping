# Web_-Scraping
# Web Scraping with Selenium

This is a simple web scraping project using Selenium. The project demonstrates how to use Selenium to scrape data from websites and automate browser interactions.

## Description

In this project, we use Selenium WebDriver to interact with websites, retrieve information, and save the scraped data in a structured format (e.g., CSV, JSON). It includes basic functionality such as:

- Navigating to a website
- Extracting data (text, links, images, etc.)
- Storing the data into a file
- Handling dynamic content (JavaScript-rendered pages)
  
This project can be extended to scrape data from various sites, with additional features like error handling, waiting for page loads, and managing sessions.

## Features

- Scrapes data from dynamic web pages.
- Saves the data into CSV/JSON files.
- Automates browser tasks using Selenium WebDriver.
